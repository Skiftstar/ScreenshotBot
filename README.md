# ScreenshotBot-with-Clicks
This program allows you to select an area, the amount of screenshots, the point that will be clicked after each screenshot and a delay between screenshots. Really useful for sites that don't provide a downloadable pdf format for their pages and you don't want to screenshot them manually

Choose your first and second Postion (the corners of the area that you want to screenshot) and the Position where the Program has to click after screenshotting.

If you type 'true' in the TextArea that asks if you want a key press, then the program presses the right arrow button every time after screenshotting.
In this case you still have to set your click position tho, so that your browser is always in focus when the key press happens.
